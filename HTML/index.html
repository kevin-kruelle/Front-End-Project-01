                <p>Our natural world is in terrible shape and it is no secret. Our unsustainable system is causing climate chaos and putting over one million species at risk of extinction.</p>
                <p>In the future we envision, the world embraces renewable energy, electric transport, breakthrough technologies and market policies to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the century. </p>

                <h3>Solving the climate crisis is possible!</h3>
                <p>Based on estimates in the 2018 intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, we have just over a decade to drastically curb our emissions to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Staying at or below 1.5&#8451; means we have to slash our greenhouse gas emissions 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p>

                    <li><strong>Technological &amp; Financial solutions:</strong><br>
                    We must incentivize a clean energy future.</li>
                    <li><strong>Political Will:</strong><br>
                    With the right people in public office, we can work with them to make climate a top policy priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Shift:</strong><br>
                    Our nation's attitude about climate change needs to shift, so that not acting on climate is no longer an option.</li>
